# Ember-contribute [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sivakumar-kailasam/ember-contribute.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sivakumar-kailasam/ember-contribute)

Consolidates issues from different official ember repos and popular ones.
Good for contributors to identify issues that they can work on.

This was inspired by the list created for the contributors workshop from EmberConf.
So if you're running an Ember meetup, you can use this app to run a contribution night.
Open to feedback via issues.
